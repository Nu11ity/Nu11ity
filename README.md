# Hi 👋, I'm Phillip!


## 🚀 About Me
My journey into game development kicked off in the fall of 2014, after a lot of soul-searching about what I wanted to do with my life. I came to the realization that if I was so absorbed in playing games, why not dive into creating them? That decision led me to enroll at my local college, where they offered degrees in game development. At first, I was all in on design—until I had to take an intro to game programming course. That’s when everything changed. What started as a required class turned into a revelation: I fell in love with programming. There was just something about solving problems and getting the code to work that clicked with me on a level I hadn’t felt before. So, I decided to double down and go for degrees in both Game Design and Game Programming, which I proudly earned in early 2018.

Indie development found me in the summer of 2017, still fresh in college. I’d always been told how crucial it was to gain experience as a student, so I teamed up with some fellow classmates, and together, we founded Broke Noobs Games. Our mission? To learn by doing—creating and releasing games from start to finish. Our first project, Stickman Awakenings, was a beat'em up mobile game that made its way onto the Google Play Store. We followed that up with The Fog's Witness, a niche horror game for mobile. But like all good things, Broke Noobs Games came to an end after most of us graduated. The studio served its purpose, and we all moved on with more knowledge and experience under our belts.

Then came Trinity Experiences. This all started when I picked up a VR headset and couldn’t put it down. I had a blast creating a simple bow-and-arrow scene, and it hit me—this is the platform I wanted to focus on next. I reached out to a couple of school alumni who I knew were as passionate as I was, and together, we formed Trinity Experiences. The name came from our trio, and our goal was to deliver unforgettable experiences. Our flagship project, Hollow Remnant, was a dark medieval fantasy adventure in VR, and it was a beast to develop. I wore many hats—programming, design, art, VFX, lighting, optimization, you name it. I learned more from this project than anything I’d done before. But despite a strong reception, Hollow Remnant didn’t hit the financial goals we needed. We tried one last push with a new project, an open-world adventure game called It’s a Slime Eat Slime World, but ultimately, the team disbanded due to various challenges.

After Trinity Experiences, I needed a break. I took some time to work as a gardener and then as a contract in-home caretaker. But the passion for game development never left me. At the end of 2022, I formed Nevermorrow Games, a solo indie studio, as a way to keep creating and stay sharp in this ever-evolving industry. I still work mostly with Unity and C#, but I’ve also been diving into Unreal Engine. Let me tell you, there have been some growing pains, but I can see why it’s so appealing—Blueprints, easy setup, and its stunning lighting and rendering out of the box are hard to beat.

Right now, I’m looking for a team that values collaboration and has a warm, supportive atmosphere. I’m not a unicorn hire; I’m just a guy who’s passionate, has failed and learned a lot, and is ready to put all that experience to good use. I’m confident that, given the chance, I’d outperform any so-called unicorn out there.
