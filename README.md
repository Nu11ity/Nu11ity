<h3 align="center">Are you in need of a Unity developer? Do you need help creating a modular framework, an agile or scrum development process, or possibly something more on the niche spectrum? Hello there! I'm a Unity developer and I help clients solve these very needs. I achieve this by using strong development foundations to create breathtaking experiences. This knowledge stems from my tutelage under industry professionals at college, and from my time working on commercial titles. I help clients with: - Designing modular workflows to allow for a smooth development pipeline. - Develop optimized frameworks that'll allow for ideal performance. - Having clear communication between the developers, artists, and producers. - Identifying and designing development tasks based on client specifications. Working with me you'll receive updates, alongside fast and clear communication across the development pipeline. If any of that interests you, contact me! Sincerely, Phillip Gonzales P.S. Regardless of if you don't choose me for this particular need, keep my profile handy in any future case you may have later.</h3>
